                              8.2 When you add or use a new Payment Method, COMMONWEALTH LOCUM TENANS CONNECTIONS LLC Payments may
                              verify the Payment Method by authorizing a nominal amount or by authenticating your account via a
                              third-party payment service provider. When you add a Payment Method during checkout, we will
                              automatically save that Payment Method to your COMMONWEALTH LOCUM TENANS CONNECTIONS LLC Account so it
                              can be used for a future transaction.

                              information and charge your Payment Method as outlined in this Section. If your Payment Method’s
                              account information changes (e.g., account number, routing number, expiration date) as a result of
                              re-issuance or otherwise, we may acquire that information from our financial services partner or your
                              bank and update your Payment Method on file in your COMMONWEALTH LOCUM TENANS CONNECTIONS LLC Account.

                              COMMONWEALTH LOCUM TENANS CONNECTIONS LLC Payments is not responsible for any loss suffered by you as
                              a result of incorrect Payment Method information provided by you.

                              8.5 Each Party to these Terms acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding the fact that COMMONWEALTH
                              LOCUM TENANS CONNECTIONS LLC Payments is not a party to the agreement between Practices and Providers,
                              COMMONWEALTH LOCUM TENANS CONNECTIONS LLC Payments acts as the Provider’s payment collection agent for
                              the limited purpose of accepting payments from Practices on behalf of the Provider. Upon the
                              Practice’s payment of funds to COMMONWEALTH LOCUM TENANS CONNECTIONS LLC Payments, the Practice’s
                              payment obligation to the Provider for the agreed upon amount is extinguished, and COMMONWEALTH LOCUM
                              TENANS CONNECTIONS LLC Payments is responsible for remitting the funds to the Provider in the manner
                              described in these Terms, which constitute COMMONWEALTH LOCUM TENANS CONNECTIONS LLC’s agreement with
                              the Practice. In the event that COMMONWEALTH LOCUM TENANS CONNECTIONS LLC Payments does not remit any
                              such amounts, the Provider will have recourse only against COMMONWEALTH LOCUM TENANS CONNECTIONS LLC
                              Payments and not the Practice directly.

                              17.1 Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and COMMONWEALTH LOCUM TENANS CONNECTIONS LLC each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact COMMONWEALTH LOCUM TENANS CONNECTIONS LLC’s customer service team by emailing us. If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration.
